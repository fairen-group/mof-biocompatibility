The entirety of the code here with the exception of fragmentor.py & parser.py was developed in the work presented by Jablonka and colleagues.

The only reason we have the entire code here is because we were initially having issues integrating moffragmentor into our pipeline, and we wanted to tweak some features. 

If for your work, you use any part of this code, please do not forget to cite: Jablonka, K.M., Rosen, A.S., Krishnapriyan, A.S. and Smit, B., 2023. An ecosystem for digital reticular chemistry.
